### Created Enum:
- An Enum named MortgageRate was created to represent different mortgage rates. It likely includes options such as FIXED_1, FIXED_2, VARIABLE_1, etc. Enums are useful for representing fixed sets of constants.

### Created Class:
- A class named Mortgage was created to represent individual mortgage instances. This class likely includes properties such as loan_amount, rate, frequency, and amortization_period, along with methods for calculating payments and string representation.

### Created Unit Test Class:
- A Unit Test class was created to ensure the functionality of the Mortgage class. This class includes test methods for various scenarios such as invalid inputs, modifying loan amount, rate, frequency, and amortization, as well as calculating payments and string representations.

### Updated Client Program:
- The client program, likely named main.py, was updated to incorporate batch processing of mortgage loan data. This likely involved reading data from an input file, creating instances of the Mortgage class, calculating payments, and writing results to an output file.#
